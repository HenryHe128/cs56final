1. What are the names of group members?
Johnny Haro, Allison Serrano, Yuqi He, Jingbo Jiang, Cesar Bautista
2. What Java version are you using?
21
3. What IDE are you using?
Visual Studio Code
4. What challenges were you facing?
I have never tried to collaborate on a program online, which is challenging for me. When it comes to making javaFx, which is a visual interface, there are some differences from the java language. Some of the setting statements have not been used before, and I am not familiar with their features, which wastes a lot of time.

5. Is there anything that is not working? If so, what is it and what have you tried to get it to work?
It seems that a single button can only trigger one command, so there is no good way to use the method in the class while receiving the text in the textfield in the friendlist. So my solution was to add a new button and use this button to trigger the method.
